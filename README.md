# Practice Repository

This repository presents a system for the early diagnosis of pneumonia based on chest X-ray images. The system provides a graphical interface that allows you to predict the presence of pneumonia based on image analysis performed by a trained neural network.

This system can be used on any operating system where Docker is installed.

## Contents

- **backend**: Contains backend code in ะก++.
- **db**: Database related files and scripts.
- **frontend**: Frontend code and resources.
- **ml**: Machine learning models and notebooks.
- **py_backend**: Additional backend code in Python.
- **docker-compose.yml**: Docker Compose file for container orchestration.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- Docker Compose

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```sh
